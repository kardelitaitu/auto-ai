Tweet from @technews:
"Just discovered that AI can now write code better than most junior developers. The future is here."

=== OTHER REPLIES ===
1. @dev1: This is terrifying for new grads honestly
2. @coder42: Meanwhile I still cant get AI to center a div
3. @skeptical_sam: Give it a few years and it will be writing entire microservices
4. @senior_lead: It writes the code, but can it explain *why* it chose that specific pattern? Dou
5. @stack_overflow_vet: RIP to my reputation points. AI is the new Google.
6. @product_pro: If it speeds up the MVP phase, I am all for it. Juniors need to level up to arch
7. @bug_hunter: I spent 3 hours debugging AI code yesterday. It was confident, but completely wr
8. @frontend_fan: Still waiting for it to handle complex CSS animations without losing its mind.
9. @backend_guru: The logic is 80% there, but the edge cases are where the real engineering happen
10. @ai_optimist: This just means we get to spend more time on high-level strategy and less on boi
11. @security_first: Hope people realize the security risks of blindly pasting AI-generated snippets.
12. @old_school_c: Wake me up when it can manage memory as well as a human in C++.
13. @career_coach: Juniors: Start learning how to prompt and audit. That is your new job descriptio
14. @open_source_hero: Is the training data even legal? The licensing discussion is going to be a mess.
15. @no_code_nic: First it was low-code, now its AI. The barrier to entry is officially gone.
16. @crypto_coder: Wait until we integrate this into smart contract auditing. Game changer.
17. @ui_ux_designer: Coding is one thing. Understanding user empathy is another.
18. @data_viz_expert: It handled my Python data cleaning script in seconds. I am impressed.
19. @embedded_guy: I would like to see it write a driver for a custom FPGA. Then we can talk.
20. @quantum_leap: We are just scratching the surface. This is the 1990s internet moment for dev.

**SPECIAL INSTRUCTION**: Make a witty, playful, or slightly sarcastic observation. MAX 10 WORDS. One sentence. No mentions.
