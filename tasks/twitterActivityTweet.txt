Government says economy grew 5% but I just lost my job at the textile factory last week. Math isn't mathing. #PHK
Wait so PPN is really 12% next month? Does that mean my skincare and data plan go up too? I am actually cooked. #PPN12Persen
IHSG red again. My portfolio is down 40% YTD. I should have just bought gold like my dad told me. Pain. #IHSG
Just saw the rice price at the market. 21k per kilo?? How are we supposed to feed our kids with these wages? #Sembako
DeepSnitch AI presale looking tasty. If I 10x this I can finally pay off my pinjol debt. Sending it fully. #Crypto
World Bank report is pure propaganda. "Digital foundations" while rural schools have no internet. Wake up. #Ekonomi
They say inflation is low but have you tried buying Pertamax lately? 12.750 is robbery. Wallet is crying. 😭⛽ #BBM
Bitcoin is the only exit strategy from this fiat collapse. IDR losing value every year. Study money. #Bitcoin
Boomer uncle asked me what "fanum tax" is at dinner. I told him it's the new 12% VAT. He got so mad lol. #GenZ

Government: "We are resilient." Me: Eating instant noodles for the 5th time this week. Make it make sense. #AnakKos
XRP finally moving? Charts look like a breakout to $5.85. Dark Defender was right all along. LFG army! 🚀🌑 #XRP

Just put my life savings into USDT. Not trusting the banks with this volatility. Venezuela style moves. #Keuangan
My aura is -1000 after seeing my electricity bill. Everything is expensive except our salaries. So done. #Struggle
Gold is the only real money. Bitcoin is imaginary computer code. When the grid goes down you'll see. #Emas
If you think the government cares about retail investors, you are the exit liquidity. Trade carefully. #Saham
Pertamax Turbo 13.750 now? Guess I'm walking to work. Or maybe I'll just sell my car and buy more BTC. #BBM
Layoffs everywhere but the malls are full? Who is spending money? Is everyone just using PayLater? #Bingung
The elites are suppressing the real inflation numbers. Real inflation is at least 15%. Do your own research. #Konspirasi
Zoomers complaining about jobs but spend all day on Roblox playing KPop Demon Hunters. Get to work! #GenerasiMuda
IHSG trying to break resistance but volume is weak. Foreign investors are leaving for India and Vietnam. #Investasi
Is it too late to ape into DeepSnitch? I need a 100x gem to retire my parents before the crisis hits hard. #Altcoins
Government raising tax to 12% during a layoff storm is actually diabolical work. They want us to crash out. #Pajak

They distracted us with the election and now they drop the 12% tax bomb. Classic misdirection tactics. #Politik
My portfolio is bleeding but at least I have my memes. The "6 7" trend is the only thing keeping me sane. #Vibes
Textile industry is completely decimated. We are importing everything now. Where is the nationalism? #ProdukLokal
Buying the dip on these tech stocks. Random Forest model predicts a rebound in May 2026. Trust the data. #IHSG
Pertalite is still 10k but the queue is 2km long. Is it worth the time or should I just pay for Pertamax? #Bensin

Why is nobody talking about the Yamaha factory closing? That's thousands of families with zero income. #Berita
USDT adoption in Indo is skyrocketing. People are waking up. The Rupiah is a melting ice cube. #Crypto

Fiscal sustainability they said. Just say you want more money for projects that don't help the poor. #Pajak
Tech sector is the only thing growing but you need 5 years experience for an entry level job. Make it make sense. #IT
Just bought more gold bars. Physical only. If you can't hold it, you don't own it. Stay safe everyone. #Investasi
I miss the days when 100k could buy you a full cart of groceries. Now it's barely enough for oil and rice. #Inflasi
Prediction: IHSG will crash to 6000 by Q1 2026. The bubble is bursting. Cash is king right now. #BearMarket
Everyone is talking about AI crypto coins. DeepSnitch to the moon? Or just another rug pull? I'm engaging. #Degen
My dad is mad about the fuel price but refuses to sell his massive SUV. The boomer mindset is fascinating. #Keluarga
If PPN goes to 12%, businesses will just evade taxes. The black market is about to boom. Unintended consequences. #Ekonomi
Just saw a video about the "6 7" meme and I still don't get it. Am I too old or is it just dumb? #Internet

IHSG missing the 20% rise target is the biggest rug pull of the year. Analysts were lying to us. #Saham

Rice is expensive, jobs are scarce, but hey at least the internet speed in Jakarta is okay right? #Prioritas
My boss just fired 10 people today. Said "cost adjustments" for 2026. I'm scared I'm next. Pray for me. #Kerja
DeepSnitch AI looks legit. Presale is 85% filled. I might drop 1 BNB just in case it moons. #Altcoins

Every time I check the news it's "layoffs" or "price hikes." I need a detox from reality. Roblox time. #MentalHealth
Pertamax up again. Everything up again. But my salary is the same as 2019. This is sustainable? #Gaji
If you aren't shorting the IHSG right now you hate money. The chart is screaming capitulation. #Trading
Bitcoin maxis are annoying but they might be right. The fiat system is showing cracks everywhere. #Keuangan
Can we pay the "fanum tax" with aura points? Because I have no actual money left in my bank account. 💀✨ #GenZ
Sritex was a national icon. If they can fail, no company is safe. Winter is coming for Indo industry. #Bisnis
I'm just gonna sleep until 2027. Maybe the economy will be fixed by then. (It won't). #Tidur
Pertalite users are safe for now but for how long? Subsidies won't last forever. Prepared for the worst. #Bensin
Stop checking the charts every 5 minutes. Go outside. Touch grass. The market will do what it does. #Saran
Government says 62% of SDG targets on track. Which ones? The poverty ones? I don't see it. #PBB
If XRP hits $5 I'm buying my mom a house. If it crashes I'm moving back in with her. High stakes. #Crypto
Why is rice 21k in Sulawesi? That's insane. We are an agrarian country why are we starving? #Pertanian
IHSG is basically a casino where the house (foreigners) always wins. Retail is just donating money. #Judi

My timeline is full of "It's over" memes. The sentiment is historically bad. Bottom signal? #Contrarian

People buying "DeepSnitch" are the same people who bought NFTs in 2021. Have fun staying poor. #Scam
I'm bullish on Indonesia long term but bearish on my bank account short term. The struggle is real. #Ekonomi
If you look closely at the GDP data, it's all consumption. We are spending money we don't have. Bubble. #Analisa

Bitcoin to 100k is inevitable. The PPN hike is just more reason to opt out of the system. #BTC
