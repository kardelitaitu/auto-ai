### ✅ version 0.5.3
(02 March 2026) Humanization Stability & Math Utility Fixes
- **Fixed `randomInRange` Error**: Resolved the `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'randomInRange')` error by correcting the dynamic import logic in `api/behaviors/scroll-helper.js`.
- **Unified Math Utilities**: Consolidated all `api/behaviors/humanization/` modules to import `mathUtils` from `api/utils/math.js` for centralized management.
- **Corrected API Signatures**: Updated all `scrollRandom()` calls across the codebase to remove the redundant `page` parameter, ensuring alignment with the unified API.
- **Final Session Verification**: Confirmed that the `api-twitteractivity` task now runs successfully through full session cycles (navigation, reading, engagement).

### ✅ version 0.5.2
(01 March 2026) API Module Independence & Consolidation
- **Consolidated API Structure**: Successfully moved core logic from root `utils/` and `core/` folders into the `api/` directory, making the `@/api` module completely independent.
- **Import Resolution**: Corrected hundreds of relative import paths across `api/agent`, `api/actions`, `api/behaviors`, `api/utils`, and `tasks/`.
- **Fixed missing exports**: Restored `quoteWithAI` and `replyWithAI` functional wrappers in `api/index.js` by pointing them to corrected `api/actions/` implementations.
- **Module Maintenance**: Renamed `api/core/health-circuit-breaker.js` to `api/core/circuit-breaker.js` to resolve `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` in `AgentConnector`.
- **Cleanup**: Deleted legacy root `utils/` and `core/` directories after verifying successful initialization with `node main.js`.

### ✅ version 0.5.1
(01 March 2026) Proxy Assignment Enhancements & CLI Support
- **Enhanced Proxy Assignment (`ixbrowser-proxies-pasang-tok.js`)**:
    - **CLI Support**: Added ability to target specific profile IDs or ranges (e.g., `node script.js 111-115`).
    - **Robust API Handling**: Implemented a 3x retry mechanism with exponential backoff for all local API calls (`profile-list`, `profile-update`).
    - **Direct Mapping**: Refined logic to ensure Profile ID `N` always receives Proxy Line `N` from `proxies.txt`.
    - **Stability Delays**: Added a 200ms cooling period between profile updates to prevent local API congestion.
- **Git Hygiene**: Updated `.gitignore` to strictly exclude `proxies.txt`, `settings.json`, and local log files.

### ✅ version 0.5.0
(01 March 2026) Engagement Limit Enforcement & Config Pipeline Fixes
- **Fixed Reply/Quote Context Bug**: `api.replyWithAI()` and `api.quoteWithAI()` now work correctly in `api-twitterActivity.js`. Root cause: both execute overrides called these functions outside an `api.withPage()` context, causing `getPage()` → `ContextNotInitializedError`. Fixed by wrapping both calls with `api.withPage(page, ...)`.
- **Fixed Engagement Limits Not Enforced**: Quote and reply could fire more than the configured max. Root cause: `AIQuoteAction.execute()` and `AIReplyAction.execute()` checked `diveQueue.canEngage()` but never called `diveQueue.recordEngagement()` on success — counter stayed at 0. Fixed by adding `recordEngagement()` after success in `ai-twitter-quote.js`, `ai-twitter-reply.js`, and both execute overrides in `api-twitterActivity.js`. Added `canEngage()` guard to overrides as well.
- **Fixed settings.json Engagement Limits Ignored**: `config.getEngagementLimits()` was reading the wrong JSON path (`twitter.activity.engagementLimits` — doesn't exist) and always fell back to hardcoded defaults. Fixed to read `twitter.engagement.maxReplies/maxRetweets/maxQuotes/maxLikes/maxFollows/maxBookmarks` and remap keys to internal format.
- **Cleaned Up Duplicate Config Keys**: Removed unused `twitter.actions.reply` and `twitter.actions.quote` entries from `settings.json` (dead duplicates; actual values are read from `twitter.reply.probability` and `twitter.quote.probability`).

### ✅ version 0.4.9

(01 March 2026) Roxybrowser API Update
- **Updated API Key**: Changed Roxybrowser API key to `c6ae203adfe0327a63ccc9174c178dec` across configuration and connectors.

### ✅ version 0.4.8
(28 February 2026) Stable Release & Video Playback Fix
- **Fixed Media Playback**: Resolved X.com video playback issues by completely removing explicit H.264 codec spoofing from `api/utils/browserPatch.js` and `utils/browserPatch.js`. Diagnostics revealed that actively denying codec capabilities broke X.com's internal player negotiations (resulting in silent stream failures). Allowing the browser to negotiate natively restores consistent playback.

### ✅ version 0.4.7
(28 February 2026) AI-Powered Reply Integration & Bug Fixes
- **Integrated AI Replies**: Surfaced `api.replyWithAI()` in the core API. Handles context gathering, AI generation, and execution via Strategy A (Reply Icon) in one line.
- **Improved Context Extraction**: Ported optimized scrolling context extraction to the reply macro for consistent interaction behavior.
- **Fixed Media Playback**: Addressed a bug where custom Chromium builds artificially reported MP4 support. (Note: Reverted in 0.4.8)

### ✅ version 0.4.6
(28 February 2026) AI-Powered Action APIs
- **Integrated AI Quotes**: Surfaced `api.quoteWithAI()` as a high-level macro in the core API. Automatically handles tweet extraction, multi-scroll context collection, AI generation, and strategy execution in a single call.
- **Natural Scrolling & Extraction**: Refined the `quote` interaction flow to perform a unified downward "Reading" pass. Replaces robotic "scroll-then-jump" behavior with a smooth, humanized movement that loads and extracts replies simultaneously.
- **Enhanced Focus Reset**: Implemented `api.scroll.focus()` based reset before engagement actions to ensure the target element is always in the optimal "Golden View."

### ✅ version 0.4.5
(28 February 2026) API Extensibility & Hardened Error Recovery
- **Centralized Configuration**: Implemented `ConfigurationManager` (`api/core/config.js`) to unify global settings, timeouts, and environmental fallbacks, accessible universally via `api.config`.
- **Dynamic Plugin Architecture**: Engineered URL-aware contextual plugins. The `PluginManager` now dynamically evaluates and toggles loaded plugins automatically upon navigation (`api.goto`) based on each plugin's `matches(url)` manifest.
- **Strict Visual Guards**: Deprecated soft fallbacks for `click`, `hover`, and `type` inside `actions.js`. Interactions now assert strict Visual-Semantic Bounds via a newly surfaced `ElementObscuredError` before passing down to Playwright mechanisms.
- **Middleware Standardization**: Nuked redundant `executeWithRecovery` loops. All core kinetic actions now route through the unified pipeline architecture in `middleware.js` utilizing linear backoff and normalized propagation.
- **Observability Telemetry**: Added `runner._dumpDiagnostics()` to the Agent. When 3 consecutive LLM errors occur, the agent will gracefully snapshot its active DOM/Accessibility tree, variables, and history directly to the `/tmp/` directory to aid reproduction of unhandled failure states.
- **Sanitized Execution**: Achieved 0 syntax warnings, eliminated unused variables, and tightened stylistic definitions across the `api/core` logic scope.
- **Prompt Testing Suite (`prompt-test.js`)**: Upgraded to natively support "thinking" models (like `deepseek-r1` and `lfm2.5-thinking`) by extracting internal reasoning out of `<think>` tags and correctly routing requests with `think: true`.
- **Reply Engine Prompt Hardening**: Upgraded `REPLY_SYSTEM_PROMPT` in `twitter-reply-prompt.js` with extremely strict persona enforcement and negative constraints (`NEVER write "Okay" or "Yes"`) directly injected into all 22 strategies to prevent small thinking models (like `deepseek-r1:1.5b`) from defaulting to overly generic responses.
- **Terminal output fixes**: Fixed UI terminal rendering logic in `prompt-test.js` where string inputs containing CR characters would overwrite output logs.
- **Prompt Testing Model Compatibility (`prompt-test.js`)**: Repaired crashes when running small non-reasoning models (like `hermes3:8b`) by conditionally appending the `think: true` flag based on model name detection. Also implemented an explicit API preload sequence that forces local Ollama instances to load models completely into memory (VRAM) right at the script's startup rather than lagging mid-stream.
- **Prompt Testing Expansion**: Added 3 new conversation threads (Gaming, Crypto, Fitness) to `prompt-test.js` to improve output variance testing. The script now also randomly selects a single thread to test on each execution instead of running them all sequentially.

### ✅ version 0.4.4
(28 February 2026) API Refactoring & Bug Fixes
- **Decoupled GhostCursor**: Extracted domain-specific click profiles to `api/profiles/click-profiles.js`, making the core cursor utility domain-agnostic.
- **Improved Observability**: Replaced silent, swallowed exceptions in patching and initialization sequences with robust warnings and event emitters.
- **Robust Semantic Hashing**: Upgraded agent loop detection in `api/agent/runner.js` to use a semantic hash that strips dynamic temporal noise (timestamps, IDs) from AX Trees.
- **Navigation Safety**: Enhanced `smartClick` recovery to respect deliberate navigation via an `expectsNavigation` flag, stopping aggressive rollback.

### ✅ version 0.4.3
(28 February 2026) Automator Reconnection & Session Stability
