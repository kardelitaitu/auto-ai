- only edit what i ask you to edit, always ask permission before editing other than mentioned files
- node -c <filename>.js before marking as done
- update AGENT-JOURNAL.md if you edit any files
- update patchnotes.md after we push to git
- if you create script to batch edit files, name it gemini-edit-<file-name>.js on root folder
